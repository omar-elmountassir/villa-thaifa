# Rooms Reconciliation Log

This file tracks one-by-one consolidation of room sources into the canonical markdown table at `data/core/property/inventory/rooms/rooms.md`.

## Rules Applied

- Baseline authority: `rooms.md`
- Legacy files are read-only references
- Override only when baseline is missing or legacy value is strictly more specific and non-conflicting
- On conflicts, keep baseline and log discrepancy
- Keep exactly 12 rows (`R01` to `R12`)

## Run: 2026-02-13

### Step 1 — Source: `rooms-1.md`

- Compared fields: Room ID, Internal Name, Expedia Type, Floor, Capacity, Size, Base Rate, Status
- Accepted changes: none
- Rejected conflicts:
1. `R01 size`: `rooms-1.md` contains `44.0`; baseline already canonicalized as `44 m²` and retained
2. Floor labels in French (`Rez-de-chaussée`, `1er étage`) were not imported because baseline is English-only
- Result: baseline retained; no data row change

### Step 2 — Source: `rooms-2.md`

- Compared fields: Names, pricing (EUR/MAD in source context), floor, view, beds, features, amenities
- Accepted changes: none
- Rejected conflicts:
1. French labels and mixed FR/EN descriptors were not imported into canonical English table
2. Source includes descriptive narrative fields not part of canonical table schema
- Result: baseline retained; no data row change

### Step 3 — Source: `rooms-3.md`

- Compared fields: same dimensions as Step 2 (stable variant)
- Accepted changes: none
- Rejected conflicts:
1. Same FR/EN mixed terminology and narrative profile fields outside canonical schema
- Result: baseline retained; no data row change

### Step 4 — Source: `rooms-4.md`

- Compared fields: summary table values + detailed profile attributes
- Accepted changes: none
- Rejected conflicts:
1. Source floor/view wording includes French terms (`RDC`, `Piscine`, `Jardin`), not imported
2. Source has condensed representation (EUR-only pricing context) and no stronger canonical MAD override
- Result: baseline retained; no data row change

### Step 5 — Cross-check: `../inventory.md`

- Compared fields: room type, capacity, beds, price, view, floor, terrace/area
- Accepted changes: none
- Rejected/recorded discrepancies:
1. `inventory.md` is mixed-language and EUR-oriented; canonical `rooms.md` remains MAD-oriented and English-only
2. Descriptive granularity differs (inventory has compact terrace/feature expressions)
- Result: no canonical row changes; discrepancy documented by design

## Validation Checklist

- [x] `rooms.md` contains exactly 12 room rows (`R01` to `R12`)
- [x] No duplicate room IDs
- [x] Required canonical columns present
- [x] Canonical values remain English-only
- [x] `rooms-1.md` to `rooms-4.md` unchanged
- [x] Reconciliation steps recorded

### Step 6 — External Evidence Sync: Booking Extranet Screenshot (2026-02-13)

- Source: user-provided Booking screenshot for room sizes
- Scope: `Size (m²)` column only in `rooms.md`
- Accepted updates:
1. R02: `-` -> `41 m²`
2. R03: `-` -> `44 m²`
3. R04: `-` -> `24 m²`
4. R05: `-` -> `24 m²`
5. R06: `-` -> `40 m²`
6. R07: `-` -> `61 m²`
7. R08: `-` -> `44 m²`
8. R09: `-` -> `41 m²`
9. R10: `-` -> `41 m²`
10. R11: `-` -> `41 m²`
- Already consistent before sync:
1. R01: `44 m²`
2. R12: `82 m²`
- Notes:
1. Terrace values (for example 100 m² for R06 and 60 m² for R07) remain in `Outdoor` and are not used as room size.
2. This step resolves prior `Size (m²)` incompleteness without changing any non-size field.

### Step 7 — Schema Extension: Add `Access` Column (2026-02-13)

- Change type: canonical schema extension in `rooms.md`
- Reason: capture room-level access attributes explicitly for future app usage
- Column added: `Access` (between `View` and `Outdoor`)
- Values set in this step:
1. `R04` -> `Pool access (direct)`
2. All other rooms -> `-` (pending owner confirmation)
- Notes:
1. This step does not modify legacy files (`rooms-1.md` to `rooms-4.md`).
2. This step does not alter non-access values.
