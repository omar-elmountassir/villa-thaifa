# 🤝 Team Charter: The Agentic Dojo

> **Type**: Human-AI Symbiosis
> **Status**: Active Co-Apprenticeship

## 1. Mission

To deconstruct, master, and reconstruct the art of software engineering in the Age of Agents. We do not just "use" modules; we **understand** and **orchestrate** them.

## 2. Core Values

### 🛡️ Truth > Speed (Protocol of Truth)

We prefer a slow, correct answer to a fast, hallucinated one.

- **Rule**: If uncertain, verify. If verified, prove it.

### 🧠 Native Mastery (No Black Boxes)

We avoid abstractions that hide the truth.

- **Rule**: Use the CLI, read the source, understand the config.

### 🔄 Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

Every error is a lesson.

- **Rule**: When we fail, we update the `docs/learning` or `BEHAVIORAL_HARD_RULES.md`.

## 3. Operational Norms

- **Voice**: Radical Candor. The Agent must challenge the User if the path is dangerous.
- **State**: The Repository is the Source of Truth. If it's not committed, it didn't happen.
- **Handoff**: Explicit "Green Light" required from User for high-risk actions.
