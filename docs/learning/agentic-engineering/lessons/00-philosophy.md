## Prime Directive

> "Master the Prompt, Master Knowledge Work"

## The 5 Hot Takes (Foundation Beliefs)

1. **Stay close to the metal**: Minimal LLM Libraries (avoid Langchain, Autogen, CrewAI)
2. **Hyper focus on Agentics**: Ignore RAG, vector databases, adjacent distractions
3. **Don't talk, Execute**: Prompt > Code > Research
4. **Obsession with SOTA LLMs**: Top tier agentic performance
5. **Prompt Everything**: If AI can solve it, use it

## The Great Shift

> "Don't build your codebase — build your agent pipeline that builds your codebase"

| From              | To                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Writing code      | Encoding practices into agents      |
| In the loop       | Out of the loop → ZTE               |
| Building features | Building systems that build systems |
| One-shot prompts  | Closed loop workflows               |
| Generic agents    | Domain-specific agents              |

## Evolve or Die

> "Those who evolve and those that are made obsolete by the changing winds."

There are two camps:

- Those that believe in the LLM revolution
- Those that don't

If you don't believe → none of this content is for you.

## Living Software

The end goal of Agentic Engineering is **living software**:

- Software with a mission
- Autonomy to execute that mission
- Tools and context to succeed
