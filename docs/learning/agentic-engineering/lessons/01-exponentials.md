## The Core Equation

> **Compute Advantage = Value / Effort**

As you increase `x` (compute/leverage), `y` (value) increases exponentially.

| Compute Input (x) | Value Output (y) | Note                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| x = 5             | 148              | Linear-ish start          |
| x = 10            | 22,026           | Superlinear growth begins |
| x = 20            | 485,000,000      | **Explosion**             |

## The Meaning of "Compute"

"Compute" here isn't just GPU cycles. It's:

1. **Better Models**: Using Claude 3.5/3.7 vs GPT-3.5.
2. **Better Prompts**: Spec-based vs Iterative.
3. **Better Context**: R&D Framework context vs dumping files.

## Spec Prompts vs. Iterative

| Approach        | Planning | Execution | Total Time | Quality     |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Iterative**   | 0 min    | 6 hours   | 6 hours    | Low/Brittle |
| **Spec Prompt** | 1 hour   | 1 hour    | 2 hours    | High/Robust |

> **Lesson**: Invest in upfront planning (Spec Prompts) to minimize total time.

## The "J-Curve"

Our linear monkey brains struggle to grasp exponential growth.

- We think "If I work 2x harder, I get 2x results."
- Reality with Agents: "If I improve my prompt 2x, I get 100x results."

**Action**: Laser-focus on skills that offer highest leverage (Prompting, System Design, Context Engineering).
