# 🎓 Agentic Mastery Roadmap

> **Mission**: Transform from "Assistant" to "Agentic Orchestrator"
> **Timeline**: Continuous

## 🗺️ Phase 1: Knowledge Acquisition (The "Deep Dive")

- [x] **Exploration**: Map the entire Agentic Engineer curriculum.
- [x] **Preservation**: Create `docs/learning/agentic-engineering/` repository.
- [x] **Missing Links**: Identify and scrape hidden pages (Manifesto? Tools? Blog?).
- [x] **State of AI Coding**: Read "Engineering with Exponentials".
- [x] **Lesson Detail Scrape**: Attempted (Content is gated/paid). Mapped public summaries.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Internalization (The "Mindset Shift")

- [ ] **Rules Update**: Integrate learnings into `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`.
- [ ] **Role Re-definition**: Formally define "Antigravity as Orchestrator" in `docs/leadership/TEAM.md`.
- [ ] **Meta-Agent Mastery**: Fully understand `.claude/agents/meta-agent.md` capabilities.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Application (The "ZTE" Goal)

- [ ] **Fleet Construction**: Use Meta-Agent to build the missing agents (e.g., `git-manager`, `image-manager`).
- [ ] **Pipeline Creation**: Define PITER workflows for recurring tasks (e.g., "New Room Onboarding").
- [ ] **Closed Loops**: Implement self-correcting prompts in our agent definitions.

## 🚀 Phase 4: Singularity (The "Living Codebase")

- [ ] **Roadmap Automation**: `ROADMAP.md` updates trigger agent actions automatically.
- [ ] **Self-Maintenance**: Agents proactively identify and fix data drift (e.g., `data-sync-checker`).
