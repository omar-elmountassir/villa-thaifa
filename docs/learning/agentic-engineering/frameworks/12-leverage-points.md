# 🎚️ The 12 Leverage Points of Agentic Coding

> Source: Tactical Agentic Coding Course

## Definition

> "Step inside your agent's context window and see your codebase through its eyes."

The 12 leverage points maximize **what your agents can do for you**.

---

## The Core Four (In-Agent)

1. **Context Window** — What the agent "sees"
2. **Model Selection** — The brain power
3. **Prompt Engineering** — The instructions
4. **Tools Available** — The capabilities

---

## The Eight Extensions (Through-Agent)

5. **Standard Output** — Consistent formatting
6. **Types** — Type safety and contracts
7. **Tests** — Validation loops
8. **Architecture** — Project structure
9. **Domain Knowledge** — Expertise files
10. **Feedback Loops** — Self-correction
11. **Review Patterns** — Quality gates
12. **Documentation** — Context preservation

## How to Use

Stack multiple leverage points for **inevitable agentic success**:

```
Context + Types + Tests + Feedback Loops = Self-correcting agent
```
