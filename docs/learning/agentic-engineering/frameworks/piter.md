## The Framework

| Step          | Description                  | Example                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **P**roblem   | Define the problem clearly   | "Room 01 has corrupt data"      |
| **I**nput     | Specify inputs available     | "rooms.json, images in public/" |
| **T**ask      | Break down into atomic tasks | "1. Fix type, 2. Add images"    |
| **E**xecution | Define execution steps       | "Read → Validate → Write"       |
| **R**eview    | Set review criteria          | "All 17 images referenced"      |

## Usage

Replace "built for everyone" expensive cloud tools with your own **superior pipeline** that knows:

- YOUR codebase
- YOUR domain-specific problems
- YOUR engineering practices
