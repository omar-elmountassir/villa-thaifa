# 🏗️ The Core Four Framework

> Source: Tactical Agentic Coding Course

## Definition

The **Core Four** are the four fundamental components that determine agent performance:

| Component   | Description                  | How to Optimize                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Context** | The agent's context window   | Keep focused, relevant, limited    |
| **Model**   | The LLM powering the agent   | Use SOTA, match to task complexity |
| **Prompt**  | The instruction to the agent | Clear, structured, domain-specific |
| **Tools**   | What the agent can execute   | Minimal, powerful, well-documented |

---

## Key Insight

> "A focused agent is a performant agent. The context window is your agent's most precious resource - ephemeral, limited, and critical to success."

---

## Scale of the Core Four

With powerful agentic tools like Claude Code, you can exploit the scale:

- Long-running (minutes to hours)
- Self-correcting
- Self-validating
- Self-documenting

---

## Application

Stop working **IN** your codebase.
Start working **ON** your AI Agents.

How well you build and deploy agents determines success in Phase 2 of Generative AI age.
