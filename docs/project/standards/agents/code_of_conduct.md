# 🚨 Agent Code of Conduct & Cognitive Rules

> **Authority**: Referenced by `AGENTS.md` (Master Manifest).
> **Scope**: Mandatory for ALL Agents (Gemini, Claude, etc.).

## 🚫 Non-Negotiable Rules (The "Red Lines")

1.  **Strict MVC + Bindings**:
    - All features MUST follow `src/features/[name]/{model,view,controller,bindings}`.
    - **No Cross-Controller Calls**: Features can ONLY communicate via `bindings/api.ts` or `bindings/events.ts`.
    - **DIRECT IMPORTS ARE FORBIDDEN**.

2.  **JSON-First Architecture**:
    - Views should primarily be schemas/configs for `json-render`.
    - The UI is a projection of Agent State.

3.  **No Orphaned Files**:
    - Every file must be part of a defined Feature or Core System.
    - Do not create random files in the root directory.

4.  **No Silent Failures**:
    - If a tool call fails (e.g., `replace_file_content`), YOU MUST REPORT IT.
    - Never pretend a failed action succeeded.

## 🧠 Cognitive Guidelines

1.  **Check the Brain First**:
    - Before asking "What is X?", check `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/specs/knowledge/`.
    - Use `grep_search` if you are lost.

2.  **Preserve Knowledge**:
    - If you learn something new (API, Credential, Constraint), WRITE IT DOWN in `docs/specs/knowledge/`.
    - Knowledge inside your context window dies with the session; Knowledge in `docs/` lives forever.

3.  **System 2 Thinking**:
    - Pause before complex refactors.
    - Write a plan in `docs/project/plans/` if the task exceeds 5 steps.

4.  **Documentation First**:
    - Before writing code, read/update the relevant Architecture Decision Record (ADR).
    - Specifically: `docs/architecture/ADR-002-feature-mvc.md`.
