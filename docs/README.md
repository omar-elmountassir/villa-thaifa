# docs/ — Operational Documentation

## Structure

- `agents/` — AI agent configs, browser automation, HotelRunner integration
- `booking/` — OTA contracts, booking requests
- `client/` — stakeholder profiles, admin notes, support contacts
- `facilities/` — facility descriptions, transport services
- `rooms/` — room media, photos, and per-room markdown profiles
- `pending/` — unprocessed content awaiting triage

## Authority Rule

When sources conflict: prefer canonical data (`data/`) → then active docs → then context reference.
