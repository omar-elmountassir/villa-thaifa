# AGENTS.md — Villa Thaifa Workspace Contract

## Repository Structure

@docs/core/STRUCTURE.md

## Structure Documentation System

The codebase uses a tiered structure documentation approach to balance context relevance with token efficiency.

### Available Structure Files

| File                                 | Token Cost | When to Use                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/core/STRUCTURE.md`             | ~3KB       | General overview (hybrid: curated + auto-stats) |
| `docs/core/STRUCTURE-card-{role}.md` | 1-2KB      | Role-specific context                           |
| `docs/core/STRUCTURE-filtered.txt`   | ~15KB      | Detailed exploration                            |
| `STRUCTURE.txt`                      | ~50KB      | Full tree (deep dive only)                      |

### Role-Based Structure Cards

Structure cards provide pre-filtered context for specific agent roles:

- **booking**: `data/rooms/`, `data/bookings/`, `data/finance/`
- **browser**: `context/agents/browser/`, `data/property/`
- **hotelrunner**: `scripts/hotelrunner/`, `data/rooms/`
- **admin**: `data/admin/`, `data/operations/`
- **finance**: `data/finance/`, `data/bookings/`
- **guest-comms**: `data/bookings/requests/`, `context/agents/`

Load the card for your role: `docs/core/STRUCTURE-card-{role}.md`

### Maintenance Commands

```bash
make structure-cards    # Regenerate all role cards
make structure-update   # Full structure refresh
```

### When to Regenerate

Run `make structure-cards` when:

- Adding new agent definitions to `.claude/agents/`
- Creating new data domains in `data/`
- Reorganizing directory structure
- Onboarding new AI agents

Role mappings are configured in: `scripts/structure/role_mappings.yaml`

### Structure Freshness Rule

After creating new directories or adding 3+ files in a single task, run `make structure-update` before concluding the task. This keeps structure cards and stats current for subsequent agents.

### STRUCTURE.md Maintenance

This file uses a hybrid model:

- **Auto-generated**: Header stats (timestamp, file counts)
- **Curated by humans**: ASCII tree and annotations

Run `make structure-update` to refresh stats. Manually update tree when adding top-level directories.

### File Organization Rules

**Files that MUST remain at repository root:**

- `AGENTS.md` — AI agent workspace contract (this file)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code project instructions
- `GEMINI.md` — Gemini AI project instructions
- `README.md` — Standard repository documentation (universal convention)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Version history (standard convention)

**Rationale:** AI agent contract files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) must be at root for AI systems to discover and load them. README.md and CHANGELOG.md follow universal open-source conventions.

**Foundational definitions** (MISSION, STRUCTURE, PRINCIPLES) live in `docs/core/`.

**Data files** (JSON, structured markdown inventories) live in `data/`. Never place data in `docs/` or `context/`.

**Operational artifacts** (audits, handoffs, decisions, status dashboards) live in `ops/`. Never place live operational state in `docs/` or `context/`.

**Archived content** (fully processed, completed, or deprecated files) lives in `archive/` at the root. NOTE: `ops/archive/` contains unprocessed historical legacies from past migrations; be aware these may not have been fully actioned. When archiving newly completed work, use `archive/`.

**Reference material** (architecture docs, planning docs, templates, agent configs) lives in `context/`. This directory is read-only -- agents consume but do not mutate its contents during normal operations.

**Scripts and tooling** live in `scripts/`. Never place executable code in `docs/` or `ops/`.

**Workflow documentation** (how-to guides for operational procedures) lives in `docs/workflows/`.

**Client-facing documents** (stakeholder profiles, admin notes, support contacts) live in `docs/client/`.

## Directory Contract

Each top-level directory has a defined purpose, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.

### data/ -- Canonical Source of Truth

**Purpose:** The single authoritative location for all structured domain data.

**What GOES here:** Room profiles, booking records, financial data (rates, billing), property configuration, operational configs (channels, housekeeping, check-in rules, emergency procedures, maintenance schedules), facility descriptions and images, inventory data.

**What does NOT go here:** Documentation, operational artifacts (audits, decisions), scripts, reference material, anything that is not structured domain data.

**Example files:** `data/rooms/R01/profile.md`, `data/finance/rates.json`, `data/operations/channels.json`, `data/property/facilities/spa-hammam.md`

**Subdirectories:**

## Mission

@docs/core/MISSION.md

## Mandatory Workflow

Use this sequence for every operational task:

1. SCOUT
2. REPORT
3. QUESTIONS
4. ACTION
5. COMMIT — Run `make changelog`, then commit silently. Committing is Tier 1 (ACT) — commit proactively after completing a logical batch of work. No announcement needed. Pushing remains Tier 3 (ASK) — always ask before `git push`.

## Scope

This repo is **Villa Thaifa operations** — property data, rooms, bookings, guest comms, WhatsApp integration, Said Thaifa (owner) context.

## LHCM-OS (broader vision)

LHCM-OS (Lightweight Hotel Channel Management OS) is a separate, broader product vision where Villa Thaifa is the first pilot. LHCM-OS lives at `~/omar/professional/projects/lhcm-os/` — NOT in this repo. You may reference LHCM-OS docs but do not duplicate or merge them here.

## Core Principles

@docs/core/PRINCIPLES.md

## Policies

### Contestability Policy (Critical)

1. Treat all unprocessed data as potentially outdated, suboptimal, or contestable.
2. Do not silently trust legacy sources.
3. Ask Omar for clarification whenever decisions are ambiguous or high impact.
4. When asking, provide short options with one recommended default.
5. Log the chosen decision in status/reconciliation artifacts.

### Data Handling Policy

1. Legacy files are reference-only until reconciled.
2. Archive with checksum before removal from active scope.
3. Record accepted/rejected conflicts in domain reconciliation logs.
4. Do not overwrite conflicting values without trusted evidence.

### Git/GitHub Sync Policy

1. Keep repo synced at least:
   - start of day
   - after each completed domain milestone
   - end of day
2. Work from short-lived branches with explicit scope.
3. Never keep critical local-only changes unpushed.

## Definition of Done (Per Domain)

All must be true:

1. Canonical contract is explicit.
2. Validation scripts pass.
3. Reconciliation log is updated with evidence.
4. Legacy files are archived/deleted with explicit justification.
5. Status files are updated.

## Task Tracking

**Primary backlog**: [Linear](https://linear.app/el-mountassir) — all durable work items live here.

- Teams: `VT` (Villa Thaifa), `EM` (El Mountassir)
- Issue format: `EM-XXX` or `VT-XXX`
- Workflow conventions: `~/omar/operational/productivity/protocols/linear-workflow.md`

**Session-local tasks**: Use `TaskCreate` for breaking a Linear issue into execution steps within a single session. Linear = WHAT needs doing, TaskCreate = HOW to do it this session.

**Work overview**: `ops/status/work-overview.md` — comprehensive task dashboard with all pending work, priorities (P0-P5 MoSCoW+Eisenhower), dependencies, Omar/Said time estimates, and workstream grouping. Template: `~/omar/Templates/WORK-OVERVIEW.md`. Agents MUST:
- Read work-overview.md at session start to understand current state
- Update it after completing tasks (remove completed, update statuses)
- Follow the priority system defined in the file header

### Open Loops (Migrate to Linear)

1. Pending data domains: `data/pending-domains/` -- facilities.md awaiting hardening into `data/property/`
2. Large directory triage: `context/meta/knowledge/` (54 files), `context/meta/planning/` (96 files), `ops/audit/quality/` (62 files) need triage for archiving vs reclassification
