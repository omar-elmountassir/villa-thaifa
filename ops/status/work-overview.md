#### #83 — VT-45: Harden facilities domain

- **Status**: Blocked | **Priority**: P3 | **Workstream**: F — Said-Blocked
- **Domain**: data | **Type**: hardening | **Labels**: Awaiting: Said, Awaiting: #80, Awaiting: #81
- **Owner**: Sonnet (after Said) | **Estimate**: L (1h) | **Model**: Sonnet
- **Autonomy**: ACT | **Confidence**: High | **Risk**: Low | **Reversibility**: Easy
- **Omar Role**: Review | **Omar Time**: 5m | **Said Time**: 30m+ | **Contact**: Said
- **Due**: — | **Quality Gate**: Facilities domain passes validation script; no owner_pending fields remain; Definition of Done met
- **Initiative**: Villa Thaifa Operations | **Project**: Data Consolidation | **Project Health**: At Risk
- **Prerequisites**: #80 complete, #81 complete, Said confirmation
- **Related Files**: `data/property/facilities/`, `data/pending-domains/`, `scripts/validate_contracts.py`

- **Attempt History**: None
- **Description**: After #80 and #81 are complete with Said's data, harden the facilities domain: write explicit data contracts, run validation scripts, update reconciliation log, archive any superseded legacy files. Apply Definition of Done: canonical contract explicit + validation passes + reconciliation log updated + legacy files archived.
- **Output**: Hardened `data/property/facilities/`; updated validation script; reconciliation log entry

#### #144 — Plan Said-facing Vercel app

- **Status**: Blocked | **Priority**: P4 | **Workstream**: G — Future
- **Domain**: app | **Type**: planning | **Labels**: Blocked: #137, #138
- **Owner**: Opus | **Estimate**: L (1h) | **Model**: Opus
- **Autonomy**: ASK | **Confidence**: Med | **Risk**: Low | **Reversibility**: Easy
- **Omar Role**: Decide | **Omar Time**: 30m | **Said Time**: 0m | **Contact**: None
- **Due**: 2026-02-22 | **Quality Gate**: Design doc approved by Omar; scope, tech stack, and Said UX requirements defined
- **Initiative**: Villa Thaifa Operations | **Project**: Said-Facing App | **Project Health**: On Track
- **Prerequisites**: #137 complete, #138 complete (need full picture of remaining Said items to scope the app)
- **Related Files**: `data/admin/said-pending-questions.md`, `~/omar/professional/projects/lhcm-os/`
- **Related Issues**: —
- **Blocks**: None | **Blocked By**: #137, #138 | **Unlocks**: Said-facing app development; reduces Said communication overhead
- **Parent**: None | **Sub-tasks**: None | **Linear**: — | **Branch**: — | **Cycle**: —
- **Created**: 2026-02-21 | **Updated**: 2026-02-21 | **Started**: — | **Completed**: —
- **Triage Date**: — | **Milestone**: —
- **Attempt History**: None
- **Description**: Once Workstream A has maximally reduced Said's item list, plan a lightweight Vercel app for Said to answer remaining questions asynchronously. App should be appropriate for a 78-year-old non-technical user (Dutch UI, simple forms, WhatsApp-compatible). This is a design/planning task — output is a design doc, not code. Must account for LHCM-OS broader vision alignment.
- **Output**: Design doc at `context/meta/planning/said-vercel-app-design.md`
