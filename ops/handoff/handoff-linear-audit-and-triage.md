# Session Handoff: Linear Audit + File Triage

**Created**: 2026-02-19
**Workspace**: ~/villa-thaifa/
**Priority**: High — Linear issues are stale and blocking effective work tracking

---

## Context

The villa-thaifa codebase underwent massive restructuring (200+ files relocated, directory contract established, structure documentation system added, 14 files migrated from ~/omar/). Linear issues created before this restructuring are likely stale.

**Current Linear state (as of 2026-02-19):**

- 4 VT projects: Room Management, Q1 2026 Operations, OTA Integration, SSOT Migration (all Backlog status)
- 41 total issues: 36 Backlog, 6 Done, 1 In Progress (VT-26 P0 blocker)
- GitHub integration: NOT active
- VT-26 (P0 "Codebase Architecture Audit") is likely completed by recent restructuring work
- VT-19 (Anniversary event) is 19 days overdue
- VT-40 (Logo design) and VT-41 (Resume ops) were just created this session

---

## Task Graph (execute in order)

### Phase 1: Unblock (do first)

1. **Activate Linear-GitHub integration** — No sync exists. Set up bidirectional sync between Linear VT team and github.com/omar-elmountassir/villa-thaifa
2. **Update VT-26 P0 blocker** — Review against current codebase state. Likely done or nearly done. Close/update to unblock downstream issues
3. **Fix Linear MCP tools for sub-agents** — The linear-agent sub-agent type couldn't load MCP tools. Investigate ToolSearch scope or agent config

### Phase 2: Audit (depends on Phase 1)

4. **Audit all 41 VT issues** — Compare each against current codebase. Close completed, update stale, flag overdue. Key items:
   - VT-26: likely completed (architecture audit done)
   - VT-19: overdue anniversary event — needs decision
   - SSOT Migration issues (VT-30 to VT-33): check relevance
   - Room Management issues: check against current data/rooms/ state

5. **Decide: consolidate 4 VT projects or keep separate** — After audit, evaluate if 4 projects still make sense or should merge into 1

### Phase 3: Scan + Triage (can parallel)

6. **Scan ~/villa-thaifa/ for Linear-worthy items** — Find work items in files (TODOs, pending, open loops) that should be Linear issues. Key locations:
   - AGENTS.md Open Loops section
   - ops/intake/ (unprocessed items)
   - ops/handoff/ (pending work from handoffs)
   - data/pending-domains/ (domains awaiting hardening)

7. **Triage 212 files** — Three directories need triage:
   - context/meta/knowledge/ (54 files) — archive obsolete, keep relevant
   - context/meta/planning/ (96 files) — archive completed plans, keep active
   - ops/audit/quality/ (62 files) — archive old audits, keep current
