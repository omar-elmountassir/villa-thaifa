## Context

The villa-thaifa codebase underwent massive restructuring (200+ files relocated, directory contract established, structure documentation system added, 14 files migrated from ~/omar/). Linear issues created before this restructuring are likely stale.

**Current Linear state (as of 2026-02-19):**

| Item                          | State                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VT projects                   | 4: Room Management, Q1 2026 Operations, OTA Integration, SSOT Migration (all Backlog) |
| Total issues                  | 41: 36 Backlog, 6 Done, 1 In Progress                                                 |
| GitHub integration            | NOT active                                                                            |
| VT-26 (P0 Architecture Audit) | Likely completed by recent restructuring                                              |
| VT-19 (Anniversary event)     | 19 days overdue                                                                       |

## Execution Roadmap — Next Sessions

### Dependency Chain

```
VT-42 (GitHub integration fix)
  └── VT-55 (archive old repo) [blocked]
  └── enables GitHub ↔ Linear sync for all future work

VT-43 (gitignore/PII strategy)
  └── unblocks WhatsApp domain work (deferred SCAN-08)

VT-51 (GitHub identity strategy)
  └── VT-55 (archive old repo) [blocked]

VT-44 (hook E2E test) — independent, can run anytime
```

### Task Graph Instructions for Next Instance

The next session MUST:

1. Read this handoff document first
2. Create atomic tasks via TaskCreate for the wave being worked on
3. Set up blockedBy dependencies between tasks
4. Mark tasks in_progress before starting, completed when done
5. Delegate ALL execution to sub-agents (orchestrator = 0 MCP calls, 0 file writes for non-rules content)
6. Update this handoff at end of session

### Wave 3 Execution — IN PROGRESS

| Browser investigation VT-42 | VT-42 | Browser agent diagnosed root cause: branch prefix mismatch (omar ≠ omar-elmountassir) | Done | Webhook confirmed working (200 OK). Root cause: username prefix. |
| Option C applied + tested | VT-42 | Omar changed Linear format to identifier-title. Test branch vt-42-test-option-c pushed. | Testing | Branch pushed, awaiting confirmed link on VT-42. Clean up test branch after. |
| VT-42 deep investigation | VT-42 | Browser + Gemini + researcher: full investigation of branch auto-linking | Done | Root cause: "Branches" sidebar feature doesn't work despite correct config.

**New Linear issues this sub-session**: VT-59-65 (from manifest.csv), VT-66-70 (from missions/ extraction), VT-71-77 (validation gaps)

**Pending decisions (from missions/ archive)**:

- chambre5-sync-investigation: Dec 2025 P0 sync problem — dates expired but root cause unclear
- validation-pdf: French sign-off doc for Said — still needed or obsolete?
- rooms.md deprecation: Should master table get deprecation notice pointing to R01-R12 profiles?

**Pending decisions (from data/specs/ scoping)**:

- R7/R12 premium pricing: Were decisions made? (440€ vs 280€ for R7, 600€ vs 350€ for R12)
- Image anomaly: R05-R09 share R04 image filenames — intentional or copy error?
- chambre_et_vue.md extraction: 12 lines of Said's notes on room views/terrace/spa not in profiles
- HDR originals: Verify specs images are genuinely same as canonical (not different resolutions)

**Remaining Wave 3 work (tracked in Linear)**:

- VT-48: Close once OTA title translation confirmed (~80 historical files exempt, Said comms exempt)
- VT-49: Execute data/specs/ migration (~85 min after Omar answers 4 questions above). Close after migration done.
- Migration plan reference: `~/omar/knowledge/research/development/vt-49-data-specs-migration-plan.md`

**CRITICAL**: If `/tmp/` files are gone, VT-46 (triage epic) will need to re-run the triage agents. File categorizations are also captured in the VT-46 issue description.

## Entry Command

```bash
# Quick state check
cd ~/villa-thaifa && git status && git log --oneline -5

# Check Linear backlog
# (delegate to sub-agent — orchestrator does NOT call MCP tools)

# Check if triage reports survived reboot
ls /tmp/triage-*.md /tmp/scan-items-evaluation.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Triage reports lost — VT-46 needs re-triage"
```
