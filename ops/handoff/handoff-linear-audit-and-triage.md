# Session Handoff: Linear Audit + File Triage

**Created**: 2026-02-19
**Workspace**: ~/villa-thaifa/
**Priority**: High — Linear issues are stale and blocking effective work tracking

---

## Context

The villa-thaifa codebase underwent massive restructuring (200+ files relocated, directory contract established, structure documentation system added, 14 files migrated from ~/omar/). Linear issues created before this restructuring are likely stale.

**Current Linear state (as of 2026-02-19):**

- 4 VT projects: Room Management, Q1 2026 Operations, OTA Integration, SSOT Migration (all Backlog status)
- 41 total issues: 36 Backlog, 6 Done, 1 In Progress (VT-26 P0 blocker)
- GitHub integration: NOT active
- VT-26 (P0 "Codebase Architecture Audit") is likely completed by recent restructuring work
- VT-19 (Anniversary event) is 19 days overdue
- VT-40 (Logo design) and VT-41 (Resume ops) were just created this session

---

## Progress (2026-02-19 Session)

### Phase 1: Unblock — COMPLETED
1. **Linear-GitHub integration** — Already active. Discovered repo alignment issue: Linear points to `El-Mountassir/villa-thaifa-property-management` (old) but current repo is `omar-elmountassir/villa-thaifa`. Filed to `ops/intake/linear-github-repo-alignment.md`.
2. **VT-26 P0 blocker** — Closed as Done. Architecture audit completed via Safe Harbor migration + February restructuring. 6 downstream issues unblocked.
3. **Linear MCP tools** — Work from orchestrator, not sub-agents. Persisted in MEMORY.md.

### Phase 2: Audit — COMPLETED
- **15 issues closed** (total 41 → 26 remaining):
  - Done (4): VT-15, VT-28, VT-29, VT-41
  - Cancelled (11): VT-14, VT-16, VT-17, VT-18, VT-19, VT-20, VT-2, VT-30, VT-31, VT-32, VT-33
- **VT-2 merged into VT-9** — sub-issues VT-3→8 re-parented
- **SSOT Migration project** — all 4 issues closed as obsolete
- **Anniversary event** — cancelled by Said, all 5 issues closed
- **VT-22** (agent brief) kept open — partially done is NOT done
- **Completion Integrity rule** added to universal.md
- **Delegation Thresholds** strengthened in rules.md (zero tolerance)
- Dashboard: `~/omar/artifacts/dashboards/vt-linear-audit-2026-02-19.html`

### Phase 3: Scan + Triage — COMPLETED

**Scans (3a):** 4 parallel scans completed:
- AGENTS.md Open Loops: 2 items found (facilities hardening, 212-file triage)
- ops/intake/: 25+ items found (GitHub strategy, migration conflicts, manifest CSV)
- ops/handoff/: 13 new items found (repo alignment, language audit, archive lifecycle, governance)
- data/pending-domains/: 2 items found (facilities.md, WhatsApp DBs)

**Triage (3b):** 3 directories triaged (209 files total):
- context/meta/knowledge/: 51 files — 28 KEEP, 21 ARCHIVE, 2 NEEDS-EXTRACTION
- context/meta/planning/: 96 files — 29 KEEP, 53 ARCHIVE, 14 NEEDS-EXTRACTION
- ops/audit/quality/: 62 files — 18 KEEP, 38 ARCHIVE, 6 NEEDS-EXTRACTION

**Linear issues created (3c):** 14 new issues (VT-42 through VT-55):
- Batch 1 (P1): VT-42 (GitHub integration fix), VT-43 (gitignore/PII strategy), VT-44 (hook E2E test)
- Batch 2 (P2): VT-45 (facilities hardening), VT-46 (212-file triage), VT-47 (repath 10 docs), VT-48 (language audit), VT-49 (migration audit), VT-50 (manifest CSV processing)
- Batch 3 (P3): VT-51 (GitHub identity strategy), VT-52 (Said profile consolidation), VT-53 (communications.md review), VT-54 (TTS decision), VT-55 (archive old repo)

**Deferred items (6):** Stale GitHub issues migration, old repo archive strategy, ~/omar/ repo strategy, WhatsApp domain work, archive/lifecycle system design, WOS architecture
**Skipped items (3):** Create ops/archive/sessions/ (ACT-tier), resume project (stale), GitHub template repos (blocked)

**Triage reports:** `/tmp/triage-context-meta-knowledge.md`, `/tmp/triage-context-meta-planning.md`, `/tmp/triage-ops-audit-quality.md`
**Scan evaluation:** `/tmp/scan-items-evaluation.md`
**Dashboard:** `~/omar/artifacts/dashboards/vt-scan-consolidation-2026-02-19.html`

### Rules Updated This Session

- `~/.claude/rules/rules.md`: Delegation Thresholds rewritten with zero-tolerance enforcement
- `~/omar/core/resources/rules/universal.md`: Completion Integrity rule added
- `~/.claude/skills/delegate/SKILL.md`: Gemini-from-Claude-Code pattern documented
- `~/.claude/projects/-home-director-villa-thaifa/memory/MEMORY.md`: Gemini delegation pattern added

### New Files Created

- `ops/intake/linear-github-repo-alignment.md` — repo naming mismatch problem
- `~/omar/artifacts/dashboards/vt-linear-audit-2026-02-19.html` — audit dashboard
- `~/omar/knowledge/research/business/vt-linear-audit-verification-2026-02-19.md` — verification report (pending)

## Execution Roadmap — Next Sessions

### Dependency Chain

```
VT-42 (GitHub integration fix)
  └── VT-55 (archive old repo) [blocked]
  └── enables GitHub ↔ Linear sync for all future work

VT-43 (gitignore/PII strategy)
  └── unblocks WhatsApp domain work (deferred SCAN-08)

VT-51 (GitHub identity strategy)
  └── VT-55 (archive old repo) [blocked]

VT-44 (hook E2E test) — independent, can run anytime
```

### Recommended Execution Sequence

**Wave 1 — Blockers (do first, can parallel)**:
1. VT-42: Fix Linear GitHub integration (P1, 2pts) — verify Omar's config, test branch linking
2. VT-43: Define gitignore strategy for SQLite/PII (P1, 4pts) — audit PII files, update .gitignore
3. VT-44: E2E test delegation hooks (P1, 4pts) — run real HTML task, verify hook fires

**Wave 2 — Quick Wins (parallel, low effort)**:
4. VT-52: Consolidate Said profile (P3, 2pts, Quick Win)
5. VT-53: Review communications.md (P3, 1pt, Quick Win)
6. VT-51: GitHub identity strategy (P3, 2pts) — decision session with Omar

**Wave 3 — Deep Work (sequential, high effort)**:
7. VT-47: Move 10 misplaced docs (P2, 4pts) — read + move + update refs
8. VT-48: Language audit French removal (P2, 8pts, Deep Work) — grep scan + remediate
9. VT-49: Post-bootstrap migration audit (P2, 8pts, Deep Work) — exhaustive file scan
10. VT-50: Process manifest.csv (P2, 4pts) — read CSV, create individual issues

**Wave 4 — Epics (plan before executing)**:
11. VT-45: Harden facilities domain (P2, 8pts, Deep Work) — needs Said input
12. VT-46: Phase 3 triage 212 files (P2, 16pts, Deep Work) — triage reports ready at /tmp/
13. VT-55: Archive old repo (P3, 1pt) — blocked by VT-51

**Wave 5 — Decisions (require Omar)**:
14. VT-54: TTS provider decision (P3, 2pts) — ElevenLabs vs alternatives

**Deferred (not yet Linear issues)**:
- Migrate stale GitHub issues (after VT-42)
- WhatsApp domain work (after VT-43)
- Archive/Lifecycle system design (strategic)
- Governance templates decision (needs /decide)
- WOS Architecture (strategic session)

### Task Graph Instructions for Next Instance

The next session MUST:
1. Read this handoff document first
2. Create atomic tasks via TaskCreate for the wave being worked on
3. Set up blockedBy dependencies between tasks
4. Mark tasks in_progress before starting, completed when done
5. Delegate ALL execution to sub-agents (orchestrator = 0 MCP calls, 0 file writes for non-rules content)
6. Update this handoff at end of session

### Triage Reports (from Phase 3)

These /tmp/ files contain the triage results. They are EPHEMERAL and will be lost on reboot:
- `/tmp/triage-context-meta-knowledge.md` — 51 files: 28 keep, 21 archive, 2 extraction
- `/tmp/triage-context-meta-planning.md` — 96 files: 29 keep, 53 archive, 14 extraction
- `/tmp/triage-ops-audit-quality.md` — 62 files: 18 keep, 38 archive, 6 extraction
- `/tmp/scan-items-evaluation.md` — 23 items evaluated, 14 promoted

**CRITICAL**: If /tmp/ files are gone, VT-46 (triage epic) will need to re-run the triage agents. The file categorizations are also captured in the VT-46 issue description.

## Entry Command

```bash
# Quick state check
cd ~/villa-thaifa && git status && git log --oneline -5

# Check Linear backlog
# (delegate to sub-agent — orchestrator does NOT call MCP tools)

# Check if triage reports survived reboot
ls /tmp/triage-*.md /tmp/scan-items-evaluation.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Triage reports lost — VT-46 needs re-triage"
```
