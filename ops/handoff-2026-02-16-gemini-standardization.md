# Handoff: Gemini Workflow Standardization (2026-02-16)

## Session Summary
Standardized Gemini CLI integration and model delegation strategy.

## Completed Work
1. **Gemini skill updated** (~/.claude/skills/gemini/SKILL.md):
   - Default model changed to gemini-3-flash-preview (was gemini-3-pro-preview)
   - Fixed model IDs (gemini-3-flash-preview, not gemini-3-flash)
   - Removed interactive mode sections (moved to ~/omar/ reference)
   - Added Google AI Pro tier info section
   - Added session recovery and credit preservation use cases

2. **Google AI Pro tier researched** (~/omar/knowledge/research/ai/google-ai-pro-tier.md):
   - Annual prepaid, 1500 req/day CLI, no cost concerns
   - Does NOT include API access (separate billing)

3. **AI Model Delegation rule added** (~/.claude/rules/rules.md):
   - Research → Gemini, Frontend → Gemini, Backend → Claude Opus
   - Large context (>200k) → Gemini, Credit preservation → Gemini

4. **Interactive mode reference** (~/omar/knowledge/research/ai/gemini-interactive-mode-reference.md):
   - Omar's personal reference for manual CLI usage

5. **Broken session recovered** (ops/session-recovery-017eb935.md):
   - Data Consolidation Phase A context extracted via Gemini Flash

6. **Memory persisted**:
   - Google AI Pro tier facts
   - Correct Gemini CLI model IDs (gotcha: -preview suffix required)
   - Model delegation decision

## Facilities Directory Audit

**docs/facilities/** contains 53 image files (all .jpg) across 3 subdirectories:
- `hall/images/` — 18 images (hall/reception area photos)
- `pool-garden/images/` — 25 images (pool and garden area photos)
- `spa-hammam/images/` — 10 images (spa/hammam area photos)

**No markdown files remain** in docs/facilities/ — all 5 facility profiles were successfully migrated to `data/property/facilities/` (garden.md, hall-reception.md, pool.md, services.md, spa-hammam.md).

**Decision:** Move images to `data/property/facilities/{facility}/images/` to match room pattern. To be done by the data consolidation session.

## Open Items
- [ ] Comprehensive model routing strategy (DSC-NEW in ~/omar/operational/productivity/TASKS.md) — needs dedicated session(s)
- [ ] Merge bootstrap/2026-02-13-baseline → main
- [ ] **Move facility images** from `docs/facilities/*/images/` → `data/property/facilities/*/images/` to match room pattern (DECIDED: move to data/). Mapping: `hall/images/`→`hall-reception/images/`, `pool-garden/images/`→split to `pool/images/` + `garden/images/`, `spa-hammam/images/`→`spa-hammam/images/`. Then delete empty `docs/facilities/`.
- [ ] **Full migration audit** — The facility images were missed during Phase A consolidation. Before declaring data consolidation complete, run a thorough audit of the entire repo (`docs/`, `context/`, root) to find ANY remaining files that should have been migrated to `data/`. Nothing should be assumed complete without verification. Use `tree` + `find` to scan exhaustively.

## Image Duplication Check
**Result: No duplicates found. Migration is clean.**

- `docs/rooms/` directory no longer exists on disk (exit code 2 from ls).
- `data/rooms/R{01..12}/images/` all exist with 379 total image files (jpg/jpeg/png).
- The rename from `docs/rooms/XX/` → `data/rooms/RXX/` was committed in `8b426b5` ("refactor: data consolidation Phase A + Gemini workflow standardization").
- Git status shows only 4 minor profile.md modifications in data/rooms/ — no stale copies or untracked remnants in docs/rooms/.
- No action needed on image duplication.
