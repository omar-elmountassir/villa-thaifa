# Step-Back Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-21
**Input**: Guide explaining 8 PM tool template options (Software Dev, Product Management, Marketing, Design, Project Management, Operations, IT Support, Other)

## Problem Statement

How to systematically select the right project management tool template based on team type, work nature, and industry context — not just tool features.

## Success Criteria

1. **Decision framework**: Clear criteria-based selection logic (not just "if X, choose Y")
2. **Generalizability**: Works across industries and team sizes
3. **Actionable**: Reader can make a decision in <5 minutes
4. **Beyond obvious**: Includes non-trivial insights (hybrid approaches, anti-patterns, edge cases)
5. **Evidence-backed**: Claims validated by 2+ sources

## Domain Concepts

- **Template**: Pre-configured workflow structure with terminology, views, and automations
- **Methodology**: Underlying approach (Agile, Waterfall, Kanban, Hybrid)
- **Workflow type**: Recurring vs project-based vs request-driven
- **Work visibility**: Who needs to see what (internal team vs stakeholders vs clients)
- **Iteration frequency**: How often requirements/priorities change
- **Compliance needs**: Audit trails, documentation requirements

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the REAL differentiators between templates? (beyond surface terminology)
2. When does the "safe choice" (Project Management) become a trap?
3. How do hybrid needs get served? (e.g., marketing team doing some dev work)
4. What's the cost of choosing wrong? (migration pain, team adoption friction)
5. Industry-specific considerations (hospitality, creative, technical)?
