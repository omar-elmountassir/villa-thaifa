## Sources

### Source 1: Industry Comparison Aggregator (Multiple)

- **URLs**:
  - [Asana vs Trello vs Monday - Appvizer](https://www.appvizer.com/magazine/operations/project-management/asana-vs-trello-vs-monday)
  - [Best PM Tools Compared - CSMIS](https://csmis.org/2025/10/01/best-project-management-tools-compared-jira-asana-trello-ms-project/)
  - [Asana vs Jira - Plaky](https://plaky.com/blog/asana-vs-jira/)
- **Type**: Practitioner
- **Key Claims**:
  - Jira = specialized for software development, Agile-native, fewer but deeper templates
  - Asana = general task management, intuitive UI, many templates across industries
  - Monday = flexible middle ground, Scrum templates available
  - "Best tool is the one you actually use every day" (trial approach recommended)
  - Cross-tool integration possible (Zapier, Make) for hybrid teams
- **Evidence Quality**: Moderate (feature comparison, but commercial bias possible)
- **Potential Bias**: Comparison sites may favor tools with affiliate relationships

### Source 2: Methodology Selection Research

- **URLs**:
  - [Agile vs Waterfall Decision Model - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921002702) (abstract only, full paper paywalled)
  - [Agile vs Waterfall - Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/agile-vs-waterfall-vs-kanban-vs-scrum)
  - [PM Methodologies - Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-guide/project-management-methodologies/)
- **Type**: Research + Practitioner
- **Key Claims**:
  - Academic model uses 15 criteria across 5 categories: scope, time, costs, organization context, project-team characteristics
  - Agile = evolving requirements, customer feedback critical, rapid iteration needed
  - Waterfall = fixed scope, sequential dependencies, compliance-heavy industries
  - Kanban = continuous flow, no fixed sprints, priority changes frequently
  - Hybrid approaches exist (Waterfall planning + Agile execution, Scrumban)
  - "Project environment is significant alongside methodology execution"
- **Evidence Quality**: Strong (academic research + practical validation)
- **Potential Bias**: None significant

### Source 3: Hospitality Industry Specifics

- **URLs**:
  - [Agile in Hospitality - CRR Hospitality](https://crrhospitality.com/blog/implementing-agile-project-management-in-the-hospitality-industry/)
  - [PM for Hotels - Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/solutions/hotels/project-management-software)
  - [Hospitality PM Software - Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/blog/enterprise-hospitality-project-management-software/)
- **Type**: Practitioner (industry-specific)
- **Key Claims**:
  - Hospitality has multi-department coordination needs (housekeeping, front desk, maintenance, catering)
  - Agile benefits: flexibility to guest demands, continuous improvement, faster problem-solving
  - Challenges: stakeholder resistance, culture change, training needs
  - Recommendation: start with pilot projects, define clear objectives, use visual tools (Kanban)
  - Small hotels need: quick setup, easy to use, no complex implementation
  - Generic PM tools work if tailored; hospitality-specific PMS exist for operations
- **Evidence Quality**: Moderate (practical experience, limited academic rigor)
- **Potential Bias**: Some sources are tool vendors (Glide, Wrike)

## Convergence Analysis

| Pattern                                                    | Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3 | Confidence |

| Jira best for software/Agile-native teams                  | AGREE    | AGREE    | GAP      | High       |

## Decision Points (Disagreements)

1. **Generic PM template as "safe choice"**:

   - Source 1: Recommends Project Management as flexible middle ground
   - Source 2: Warns that methodology misalignment causes "large loss of time and cost"
   - **Resolution**: Generic PM is safe for truly undefined needs, but if work type is known, specialized templates save setup time and enforce better practices

2. **Tool vs methodology priority**:
   - Source 1: Focuses on tool features
   - Source 2 + 3: Methodology/workflow fit matters more than tool
   - **Resolution**: First identify methodology needs, THEN select tool/template

## Key Gaps (No Source Coverage)

- Long-term migration costs when changing templates
- Team size thresholds for different approaches
- Quantified productivity differences between template choices
- Multi-project vs single-project team considerations
