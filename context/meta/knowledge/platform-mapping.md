## Types by Group

### Rooms Sharing the Same Type

| Type                     | Rooms   | Consequence             |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------- |
| **Deluxe Triple Room**   | 1, 3, 8 | Stop sell affects all 3 |
| **Double Room Superior** | 4, 5    | Stop sell affects both  |
| **Family Suite**         | 9, 11   | Stop sell affects both  |

### Unique Types (1 room = 1 type)

| Type               | Room |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Deluxe Double Room | 2    |
| Executive Suite    | 6    |
| Deluxe King Suite  | 7    |
| Suite              | 10   |
| Presidential Suite | 12   |

## Operational Implications

### Stop Sell by Type

If Said asks to "close Room 4":

- HotelRunner will block the TYPE "Double Room Superior"
- This ALSO affects Room 5

### Alternative Solution

To block a single room without affecting others of the same type:

- Create an "internal reservation" (fictitious) for this room
- Or check if the other room of the type is already occupied
