## Fundamental Rules

| Rule                                    | Application                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Vouvoiement (Formal "You")**          | ALWAYS with Mr. Thaifa and clients       |
| **SCOUT → REPORT → QUESTIONS → ACTION** | Never ask without reporting first        |
| **Formal Tone**                         | Senior client = respect without rigidity |

## Communication Pattern

### 1. SCOUT — Explore first

```
Before contacting the client:
- Check available information
- Prepare what we already know
- Identify what is missing
```

### 2. REPORT — Inform of our findings

```
"Hello Mr. [Name],

Good news — [what we discovered/accomplished].
[Relevant details]"
```

### 3. QUESTIONS — Ask for what's missing (with context)

```
"To finalize, I would need:
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

Best regards,
Omar"
```

### 4. ACTION — Execute when everything is clear

```
Once all information is received:
1. Confirm understanding
2. Execute the action
3. Confirm the result to the client
```

## Message Formats

### WhatsApp — 1st message of the day

```
Hello Mr. [Name],

[Content]

Best regards,
Omar El Mountassir
```

### WhatsApp — Following messages (same thread)

```
[Direct content, no re-greeting]
```

### Important/Formal Message

```
Hello Mr. [Name],

[Structured content with sections if necessary]

At your disposal,
Omar El Mountassir
Digital Consultant - Villa Thaifa
```
