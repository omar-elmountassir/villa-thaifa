- [ ] Official SDK/Libraries?

### 4. Potential Use Cases

- [ ] Automate room blockings
- [ ] Create reservations programmatically
- [ ] Synchronize with our internal systems
- [ ] Automatic alerts (desynchronization, etc.)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] API documentation read and understood
- [ ] Report of available capabilities
- [ ] Automation feasibility assessment
- [ ] Recommendations for Villa Thaifa

## Deliverables

1. **SCOUT Report**: Summary of API capabilities
2. **Assessment**: Feasibility for Villa Thaifa
