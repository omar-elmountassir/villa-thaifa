# Sub-Agent Registry

> **SSOT for all sub-agents.** Meta-agent must update this file after creating new agents.

## Model Selection Guidelines

| Model       | Complexity    | Use Cases                                           | Speed   |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Haiku**   | Non/Low       | Summarizations, web searches, simple lookups        | Fastest |
| **Sonnet**  | Low → Mid     | Browser automation, form filling, moderate analysis | Fast    |
| **Opus**    | Mid → High    | Complex reasoning, report generation, agent creation | Slower  |

> **Rule**: Always use the MINIMUM model capable of the task. Haiku by default, escalate only when needed.

## Agent Creation Protocol

When meta-agent creates a new sub-agent:

1. **CREATE** the agent file in `.claude/agents/<name>.md`
2. **VERIFY** the file was written successfully
3. **ADD** the new agent to the table above
4. **REPORT** back to orchestrator with success/failure status

> **CRITICAL**: If creation fails, meta-agent MUST report to orchestrator for incident logging.
